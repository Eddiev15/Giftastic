# Giftastic

 This was our first foray into using api calls. I used, for the first time, Skeleton as a framework. Giftastic allows you to click on existing buttons to load 9 random gif's related to the subject, and to add your own buttons.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
